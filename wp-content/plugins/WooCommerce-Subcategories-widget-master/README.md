# WooCommerce Subcategories widget

Plugin for listing product subcategories from selected parent category.

#### Update 1.4.2

* Show product count option.
* By default it is wrapped in span tag with a class "count" in case you need to style it separately with CSS. If you simply need default visual output with brackets - choose sub-option "Show in brackets", it will replace span with brackets and make code more clean.

* The whole plugin is rewritten from scratch.
* Template function is removed due to its instability
* Shortcode is removed due to its instability
* Thumbnail dimensions (separate values for width and height) are removed.
* Thumbnail size is selected from existing presets that are registered in WordPress ecosystem (including presets that are added by other plugins and themes)
